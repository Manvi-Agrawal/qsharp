We can put together the operations defined in the previous tasks to run superdense coding protocol end-to-end.

- Prepare an EPR Pair
- Encode the two classical bits in the state of the pair by applying quantum gates to one member of the pair,
- Decode the two classical bits from the state of the pair.
- Return the result of decoding.
