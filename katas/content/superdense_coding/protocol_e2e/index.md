**Input:** Two classical bits to be transmitted.

**Goal:**  
Put together the steps performed in previous tasks to implement the full superdense coding protocol:

- Prepare an EPR Pair
- Encode the two classical bits in the state of the pair by applying quantum gates to one member of the pair,
- Decode the two classical bits from the state of the pair.
- Return the result of decoding.
